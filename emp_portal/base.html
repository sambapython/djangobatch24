            An enterprise portal, also known as an enterprise information portal (EIP), is a framework for integrating information, people and processes across organizational boundaries in a manner similar to the more general web portals. Enterprise portals provide a secure unified access point,[1] often in the form of a web-based user interface, and are designed to aggregate and personalize information through application-specific portlets.

           One hallmark of enterprise portals is the de-centralized content contribution and content management, which keeps the information always updated. Another distinguishing characteristic is that they cater for customers, vendors and others beyond an organization's boundaries.[2] This contrasts with a corporate portal which is structured for roles within an organization.
